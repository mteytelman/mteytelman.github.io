<h1> The Hobby Page </h1>

Welcome to my hobby page for this CIS HTML Project!
<h2> I am a pretty boring person and I don't want to put a lot of personal information on this so I'll just write about some stuff </h2>
<h3> I recently just thrifted a second monitor, and I realized how bad of an idea it was to cheap out on a monitor because it is in really bad condition and hurts my eyes </h3>
<h4> I guess it does in fact serve its purpose as it helps me be more efficient with work
because it has become so much easier to run and develop programs in python and on the other screen, have a tutorial on how to utilize different python libraries  </h4>
